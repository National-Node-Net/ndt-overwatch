# Changelog

**Repository:** `ndt-overwatch`  
**Description:** `Tracks all notable changes, version history, and roadmap toward 1.0.0 following Semantic Versioning.`  
**SPDX-License-Identifier:** `OGL-UK-3.0`

All notable changes to this repository will be documented in this file.  

Routine updates limited to patching GitHub Actions dependencies are excluded from new changelog entries, as they do not themselves change the functional behaviour of application software. Changes that alter workflow functionality, security controls or application behaviour remain reportable. Historical entries documenting GitHub Actions dependency updates are retained for reference.

This project follows **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** ([semver.org](https://semver.org/)), using the format:

`[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]`

- **MAJOR** (`X.0.0`) – Incompatible API/feature changes that break backward compatibility.
- **MINOR** (`0.X.0`) – Backward-compatible new features, enhancements, or functionality changes.
- **PATCH** (`0.0.X`) – Backward-compatible bug fixes, security updates, or minor corrections.
- **Pre-release versions** – Use suffixes such as `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc.1` (e.g., `2.1.0-beta.1`).
- **Build metadata** – If needed, use `+build` (e.g., `2.1.0+20250314`).

## Future Roadmap to `1.0.0`

The `0.90.x` series is part of NDTP’s **pre-stable development cycle**, meaning:

- **Minor versions (`0.91.0`, `0.92.0`...) introduce features and improvements** leading to a stable `1.0.0`.
- **Patch versions (`0.90.1`, `0.90.2`...) contain only bug fixes and security updates**.
- **Backward compatibility is NOT guaranteed until `1.0.0`**, though NDTP aims to minimise breaking changes.

Once `1.0.0` is reached, future versions will follow **strict SemVer rules**.

---

## Versioning Policy

1. **MAJOR updates (`X.0.0`)** – Typically introduce breaking changes that require users to modify their code or configurations.

- **Breaking changes (default rule)**: Any backward-incompatible modifications require a major version bump.
- **Non-breaking major updates (exceptional cases)**: A major version may also be incremented if the update represents a significant milestone, such as a shift in governance, a long-term stability commitment, or substantial new functionality that redefines the project’s scope.

2. **MINOR updates (`0.X.0`)** – New functionality that is backward-compatible.
2. **PATCH updates (`0.0.X`)** – Bug fixes, performance improvements, or security patches.
3. **Dependency updates** – A **major dependency upgrade** that introduces breaking changes should trigger a **MAJOR** version bump (once at `1.0.0`).

---

## How to Update This Changelog

1. When making changes, update this file under the **Unreleased** section.
2. Before a new release, move changes from **Unreleased** to a new dated section with a version number.
3. Follow **Semantic Versioning** rules to categorise changes correctly.
4. If pre-release versions are used, clearly mark them as `-alpha`, `-beta`, or `-rc.X`.
